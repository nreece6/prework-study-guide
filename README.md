# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide Webpage was developed as a tool to begin to practice HTML, CSS, Git,JavaScript, while also creating a living study tool that I can build upon throughout my Coding Boot Camp journey. This project helped reinforce my basic understandings of HTML and CSS, while introducing me to Git and JavaScript. The repitition of steps, specifically with Git, have helped to make me feel more comfortable going in to the first week of class.
